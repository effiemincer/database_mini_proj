 (a) CREATE FOUR VIEWS + ONE SELECT QUERY EACH + INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE STATEMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Explanation:

  We have four distinct views corresponding to four different user sub-groups:
    1. OverdueLoansView         (for librarians managing overdue books)
    2. ElectronicCardHoldersView (for card managers overseeing electronic card usage)
    3. FamilyChildTiesView       (for family-services staff focusing on parent-child relationships)
    4. UnreadNotificationsView   (for staff managing unread notifications)

  Each view:
    1. Is created with relevant SELECT logic, optionally with filtering conditions.
    2. Has one demonstration SELECT to show how the view is used.
    3. Has at least one DML (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) command to demonstrate view manipulation.

  We optionally demonstrate correct and invalid attempts to manipulate the data in each view,
  illustrating how the DBMS handles view updates and constraints.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PREREQUISITES:
    - Assumes existing tables: Readers, ReaderCard, BooksOnLoan, BooksReturned,
      FamilyTies, Notifications, with the schema you provided.
    - Assumes relevant foreign key and check constraints are in place.
    - The WITH CHECK OPTION is only applicable if a view is updatable; we use it
      in an example view to illustrate restricting updates that violate the WHERE clause.

  (a3) DML Statements on OverdueLoansView

  - We'll also show an invalid DELETE attempt (due to no real row removal logic or constraints).

/* 
   Example Invalid DELETE Attempt:
   Since OverdueLoansView is derived primarily from BooksOnLoan records, 
   deleting from the view would try to delete from BooksOnLoan. That may 
   or may not be logically permissible if constraints or application rules 
   forbid removing an active overdue record. We'll try it here and note
   possible error or warning.
