-- LOGGING AND EXPLANATIONS
-- 1. The first INSERT into BooksOnLoan succeeded because it was a valid loan record.
-- 2. The second INSERT was excluded by the `ActiveLoansView` because the loan already had a corresponding entry in `BooksReturned`.
-- 3. The addition of a loan for a new genre successfully updated the `MostReadGenresView`.
-- 4. The first DELETE from `BooksOnLoan` removed a valid loan record, while the second failed due to a nonexistent `LoanID`.

-- NOTES
-- The first view ensures loans are "active" by checking for the absence of a `ReturnID` in `BooksReturned` and the due date.
-- The second view uses a CTE with `ROW_NUMBER()` to ensure only the most-read genre per reader is included.
